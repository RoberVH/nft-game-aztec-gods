               <h1>Legend of Tezcatlipoca </h1> 
              <p>
              A long time ago, in a land far, far away, before the world was created, all that existed were a few gods, a massive ocean, and the sea half crocodile half fish monster named Cipactli.
              </p>
              <p>  Ometéotl, the God of creation had two childs: Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca. 
              </p>
              <p>
              Ometéotl ask them to defeat monster Cipactli, Tezcatlipoca lured moster Cipactli out of the ocean and close to him by using his foot as bait. 
              Then, together with his brother Quetzalcoatl, killed the beast and created the world from its body. Tezcatlipoca’s actions were costly, however;
              he lost his left foot in the process. 
              </p>
              Quetzalcoatl, being the one who stroke the last mortal blow to the monster was highly praised by Ometéotl, what infuriated and filled with envy Tezcatlipoca, so 
              an antagonism between brothers began to grow. In their fight again each other,  Quetzalcoatl  gave Tezcatlipoca a blow with a great stick, and threw him over into the water to reign the
              underworld. He then proceeded to turn himself into the second sun and created the humankind. 
              <p>
              Tezcatlipoca full of envy and resentment, metamorphosed into a jaguar and try to killed all of the 
              human race. He would try to make the big volcano Popocatépetl erupt to destroy all creation and bring his underworld 
              kingdom into surface, but Quetzalcoatl turned into a sun, petrified him with mighty rays... Tezcatlipoca was defeated but not killed
              </p>
              Tezcatlipoca devised an evil plan to take revenge on his brother and dominate the world. One day, he disguised himself as an old
              man and brought a gift to Quetzalcoatl, who received it with great joy and humility, it was a maguey that 
              brought forth a delicious liquid. However, what Quetzalcoatl did not know, was that the delicious liquid was “octli“ or “pulque“,
              an intoxicating drink.
              <p>
              Quetzalcoatl drank it with pleasure; he drank and sang like never before. He was so ecstatic and drunk, that being filled with 
              carnal desires, he took Quetzalpetatl as his woman, a priestess belonging to his cult, thus breaking his celibacy.
              </p>
              The next morning he felt utterly unclean and made the hardest decision of his life, for he was no longer worthy to lead 
              heaven. He headed for the sea, built a boat out of snakes and sailed toward the setting sun, promising to return 
              once atone for their sins in the year “Ce Acatl“ to avenge for the betrayal...... but he nnever return.
              <p>
              Now, three suns after, we are on the fifth sun, and  Tezcatlipoca again has resurfaced on this era to try dominate 
              the world, knowing that Quetzacoatl has not return, and the other Gods would not be a match for him;  so it's up to 
              you, dear viewer to come forward an chose an Aztec Deity to figth against the dark Lord of underworld and save our 
              fifth sun... and the world as we know it!
