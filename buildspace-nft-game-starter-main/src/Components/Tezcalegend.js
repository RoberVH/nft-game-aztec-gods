               <h1>Legend of Tezcatlipoca </h1> 
              <p>
              A long time ago, in a land far, far away, before the world was created, all that existed were a few gods and a massive ocean.
              </p>
              <p>  Ometéotl, the God of creation had two childs: Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca. Quetzalcoatl created the humand kind and his father was
                    proud of him, but this angered Tezcatlipoca.
              </p>
              <p>
              Tezcatlipoca full of envy and resentment, metamorphosed into a jaguar and try to killed all of the 
              human race. He would try to make the big volcano Popocatépetl erupt to destroy all creation and bring his underworld 
              kingdom into surface, but Quetzalcoatl turned into a sun and petrified him with mighty rays... Tezcatlipoca was defeated but not killed
              </p>
              <p>
              Now, three suns after, we are on the fifth sun, and  Tezcatlipoca has resurfaced on this era to try dominate 
              the world, knowing that Quetzacoatl has departured to the far ocean and has not returned, and the other Gods would not be a match for him;  so it's up to 
              you, dear viewer to come forward an chose an Aztec Deity to figth against the dark Lord of underworld and save our 
              fifth sun... and the world as we know it!
              </p>
